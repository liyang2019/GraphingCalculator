# GraphingCalculator

A calculator that can do basic calculations and draw arbitrary functions of an input variable using Swift.

• Developed a graphical calculator using MVC design pattern to plot arbitrary user input functions. Used mini-MVC for the graphics display of function curves.

• Used delegation to decouple the implementation of calculator model, calculator view, graphics model and a powerful graphics view allowing function curves to transform under various gestures.

• Analyzed the function curve data points change under gestures to speed up the function curve display.
